  <p>Good stuff! You are now set up to start texting University of Regina students. You have also received a text with instructions on how to start chatting with someone, and those instructions you can always find here. Add the number to your phone's address book as "URconnecting" so that you remember what it's for. If you don't receive a text from us, you can manually add our number to your address book and text it #play to start chatting with someone:</p>
  <h3>Add This Number</h3>
  <h1 class="text-center">(647) 725-2253</h1>
  <p>And remember, no one at the University will see your phone numbers. All texts are sent through the number above</p>
